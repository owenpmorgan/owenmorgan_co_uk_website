## Resolving Git Issues: Diverging Branches and `.DS_Store` Files

This section outlines the steps taken to resolve issues with diverging branches and 
unwanted `.DS_Store` files in a Git repository.

### Step 1: Handling `.DS_Store` Files
`.DS_Store` files, which are automatically generated by macOS in directories, can 
clutter the repository if not ignored. Here’s how to deal with them:

- **Unstage `.DS_Store` Files**: If these files have been added to the staging area 
unintentionally, you can unstage them with:
  ```bash
  git restore --staged .DS_Store
  git restore --staged images/.DS_Store

- **Verify `.DS_Store` is in `.gitignore`**: Check your gitignore file to see if 
the `dsstore` files have been added:


- **Remove `.DS_store` from the repository (if thay had been previously committed): 
  ```bash
  git rm --cached .DS_Store
  git rm --cached images/.DS_Store
  
### Step 2: Resolve the diverging branches 

The message about your branch and origin/main having diverged means that there are commits 
on both your local branch and the remote branch that are not in the other. Here’s how 
you can resolve this:

- **Stash Local Changes:** Since you have changes that are not committed, stash them 
temporarily:
  ```bash
  git stash

- **Pull Remote Changes with Rebase:** This step will update your local branch with 
changes from the remote branch (github)
  ```bash
  git pull --rebase origin main``
  
- **Resolve Any Conflicts:** If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause 
the rebase and allow you to fix the conflicts. Once you resolve any conflicts, mark 
them as resolved:
  ```bash
    git add <resolved-file>
    git rebase --continue
  
- **Apply the Stashed Changes:** Once the rebase is complete and your branch is 
up-to-date with the remote, you can reapply your stashed changes:
  ```bash
  git stash pop
  
- **Handle any new conflicts that occur**
- ** Commit and Push:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and integrated remote changes"
  git push origin main
  
That should be it, repository and the local should now be the same. Essentially I made 
committs on the main in both places. I'm not 100% sure why this was a problem, I thought 
it would read changes and merge. Something to do with the .DS_store files probably. 
Anyway the fix was to set the DS_stores to ignore, remove them from the repository, 
suspend any changes locally (stash), pull the repository changes so the local is updated 
with that, then re apply the stahsed changes and commit/push as normal, now they are in 
sync. 

Here are some overall thoughts on how to avoid conflicts in the future:

Always pull before starting work so that you are working on the latest version of the 
repository.

Be Cautious with Web Edits: Making edits directly on GitHub while also working on files 
locally increases the likelihood of conflicts. If you do make changes online (such as 
editing README files or documentation), pull these changes to your local repository 
before continuing your work.

Ignore DS_store: They are just for folder views and other OS display specific option, 
they will be nothing to do with the project.


## fonts and images are not working

This was solved fairly easily by making sure the font face type was truetype not 
TrueType, changing the name to have no spaces and fixing the location the css file 
was looking for the font in.

Previously I had `../fonts/font.ttf` which is looking for the font folder in the 
directory above the css file, but it should have been IN the css files folder. It's 
likely this was the main cause.

I also note that the browser caches css heavily to save performace so you need to 
clear the cache and then reload from source to see changes. `cmnd+shift+r` to refresh 
the webpage without the cahce. In doing so you see a very plain page, indicating loads 
of the content is from the cache.


## secret key request readable in old request for a CA certificate

When I made the neocities version and was having trouble linking the domain names to 
my account, more sepcifically sub domains like www. the subdomains were working but not 
included in the site certificate. I initiated making a request from a free CA like Let's
Encrypt, by generating a certificate request. In the end it didn't need this, the subdomains
linked to my main domain proliferated through the DNS system and issued certificates for
the subdomains in the end. The request ended up in my project folder, and for some reason
included private keys and as such was commited to my repo several times.

Although this is not probably too bad of a security risk its worth learning how to fix an
unwanted file ending up in several commits to a repo.

I downloaded

`git-filter-repo`, a python script for doing such a task using;

`pip install git-filter-repo`

Then I could try to erase all versions of the file with 

`git filter-repo --invert-paths --path '/CSR request for certificate (not submitted).txt'`

Note the need for quotes to escape the spaces.

I was met with an error saying origin (the default start point of the repo currently 
worked on) is not set (ie not a git repository)

using

`git remote -v`

You can see what remote repositories are set up for this folder on my mac. As expected 
nothing showed up. So then I could use

`git remote add origin https://github.com/owenpmorgan/owenmorgan_co_uk_website.git`

To manually add the repository on git hub to my project (php storm probably does this 
a different way so it hadn't been set up in the actual git folders in the project folder)

now `git remote v` shows push and pull available for the url to my github repo.

Now running 

`git filter-repo --invert-paths --path '/CSR request for certificate (not submitted).txt'`

runs and deletes a load of stuff, but we still need to push the changes to the repo.

For this we need to go into settings and generate a personal access token, as pushing
requires authenticating with github and UN password is no longer supported.

You can generate a PAT in settings on git hub, down the bottom. The new beta version 
didn't work so I had to use classic.

Then running `git push origin --force --all` worked and asked for my UN (not email, 
just UN) and the PAT token. Upon entering push is achieved and checking the repo all 
references to the key file are deleted.
