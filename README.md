## Resolving Git Issues: Diverging Branches and `.DS_Store` Files

This section outlines the steps taken to resolve issues with diverging branches and unwanted `.DS_Store` files in a Git repository.

### Step 1: Handling `.DS_Store` Files
`.DS_Store` files, which are automatically generated by macOS in directories, can clutter the repository if not ignored. Here’s how to deal with them:

- **Unstage `.DS_Store` Files**: If these files have been added to the staging area unintentionally, you can unstage them with:
  ```bash
  git restore --staged .DS_Store
  git restore --staged images/.DS_Store

- **Verify `.DS_Store` is in `.gitignore`**: Check your gitignore file to see if the `dsstore` files have been added:


- **Remove `.DS_store` from the repository (if thay had been previously committed): 
  ```bash
  git rm --cached .DS_Store
  git rm --cached images/.DS_Store
  
### Step 2: Resolve the diverging branches 

The message about your branch and origin/main having diverged means that there are commits on both your local branch and the remote branch that are not in the other. Here’s how you can resolve this:

- **Stash Local Changes:** Since you have changes that are not committed, stash them temporarily:
  ```bash
  git stash

- **Pull Remote Changes with Rebase:** This step will update your local branch with changes from the remote branch (github)
  ```bash
  git pull --rebase origin main``
  
- **Resolve Any Conflicts:** If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause the rebase and allow you to fix the conflicts. Once you resolve any conflicts, mark them as resolved:
  ```bash
    git add <resolved-file>
    git rebase --continue
  
- **Apply the Stashed Changes:** Once the rebase is complete and your branch is up-to-date with the remote, you can reapply your stashed changes:
  ```bash
  git stash pop
  
- **Handle any new conflicts that occur**
- ** Commit and Push:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and integrated remote changes"
  git push origin main
  
That should be it, repository and the local should now be the same. Essentially I made committs on the main in both places. I'm not 100% sure why this was a problem, I thought it would read changes and merge. Something to do with the .DS_store files probably. Anyway the fix was to set the DS_stores to ignore, remove them from the repository, suspend any changes locally (stash), pull the repository changes so the local is updated with that, then re apply the stahsed changes and commit/push as normal, now they are in sync. 

Here are some overall thoughts on how to avoid conflicts in the future:

Always pull before starting work so that you are working on the latest version of the repository.

Be Cautious with Web Edits: Making edits directly on GitHub while also working on files locally increases the likelihood of conflicts. If you do make changes online (such as editing README files or documentation), pull these changes to your local repository before continuing your work.

Ignore DS_store: They are just for folder views and other OS display specific option, they will be nothing to do with the project.





fonts and images are not working

This was solved fairly easily by making sure the font face type was truetype not TrueType, changing the name to have no spaces and fixing the location the css file was looking for the font in.

Previously I had ../fonts/font.ttf which is looking for the font folder in the directory above the css file, but it should have been IN the css files folder. It's likely this was the main cause.

I also note that the browser caches css heavily to save performace so you need to clear the cache and then reload from source to see changes. cmnd+shift+r to refresh the webpage without the cahce. In doing so you see a very plain page, indicating loads of the content is from the cache.
