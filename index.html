            He was privileged to share the stage with the since departed greats Tina May
            and Peter King.
            <br /><br />
            In the studio Owen engineered and mixed Fionn Regan's '100 Acres of Sycammore'
            and Jetsam's 'A Dream Life of Hackney Marshes', working out of the award winning

            Owen is currently undertaking a degree in electrical engineering at Royal Holloway
            University of London, less time for gigs, but with aim to enter into the green
            energy or sustainable electronics industries after graduating, which will give him
            something to do during the daytimes!
